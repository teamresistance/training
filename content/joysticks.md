The driver needs to tell the robot what to do!
### Xbox Controllers

The team uses xbox controllers to control the robot - they have a lot of buttons! Luckily, instead of having to remember button IDs, WPILib provides the`CommandXboxController`class. Assigning buttons is as easy as`controller.b().onTrue(...)`. Simply specify the button.
